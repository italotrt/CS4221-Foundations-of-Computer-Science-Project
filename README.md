# Project Specifications

 This is a project that I've made for one of my modules on my first year
 of my computer science course.

 This project was written using the DrRacket language.
 
 The requirements of for this project were:
 
 To write some Racket code that uses conditionals and/or recursion that can be mapped onto a list.
 Specifically, I needed to produce:

    * A clear statement of what the problem is;
    * Sample data that to  test your function(s) on;
    * If this data contains malformed input that your function can work around, you will get higher credit (see, for example, the material where we used filter identity);
    * Well documented  functions that you'll use;
    * Your main function (that gets mapped onto the data) should use a conditional statement in some way or, for full credit, recursion;
    * Clear instructions on how to execute your code.

 /*
  My idea was to create a short randomized fantasy story.
  Using a dice rolling system, where depending on the value of the
  dice a certain event would occur.
