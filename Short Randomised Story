;;; Problem Description: ;;;

#|
 My idea is to create a short randomised fantasy story.
 Using a dice rolling system, where depending on the value of the
 dice a certain event would occur.
|#



;;; Defining Dices ;;;

#|
 Here we will define some functions that will have lists
 of strings that will be randomly chosen in the next part.
|#


;; Players
(define D1 (vector "The Knight,"
              "The Rogue,"
              "The Mage,"
              "The Archer,"
               ))


;; Locations
(define D2 (vector "at the The Dead Maze,"
              "at the The Restless Crypt,"
              "at the The Dead Tunnels,"
              "at the Chambers of the Dishonored Monk,"
              "at the Tombs of the Secret Knight,"
               ))


;; Actions
(define D3 (vector "used the longsword to slay"
               "used the rapier to rapidly attack"
               "threw the hatchet towards"
               "used the axe to finish"
               "used the mace in an attempt to hit"
               "casted the Abomination of Chaos on"
               "casted the Blast of Darkness on"
               "casted the Jinx of Elemental Fury on"
               "casted the Void Missiles on"
               "casted the Aura of the Inferno on"
               "casted the Burst of Divine Intervention on"
                ))


;; Enemies
(define D4 (vector "Rondos, Champion Of The Skies"
              "Pandrais, The Dragonlord"
              "Miesut, The Voiceless One"
              "Sayrrian, Lord Of Fire"
              "Zeitaedeos, The Eternal"
               ))


;; Outcomes
(define D5 (vector "but died from third degree burns."
              "but got caught in a magic spell."
              "but got stabbed and bled until death."
              "and successfully defeated the enemy."
              "but was magically teletransported to another dimension."
               ))



;;; Making the random selection ;;;

#|
 Here we will define some functions that will pick a random string from
 the previous functions. By combining the vector-ref and random functions,
 we are able to so.
|#

;; Random selection for the Player
(define dice1 (vector-ref D1 (random 0 4)))


;; Random selection for the Location
(define dice2 (vector-ref D2 (random 0 5)))


;; Random selection for the Action

; Obs: In this selection I am using if statements to check the character/Player chosen on dice1
; depending on the character chosen, if it is, it will choose randomly certain actions from the D3 function.

(define dice3 (if (equal? dice1 (vector-ref D1 2)) (vector-ref D3 (random 5 11))
                  ; On this first if statement we are checking if the Player from D1 is "The Mage", if it is, it's going to give one value from a specific range from D3.

                  (if (equal? dice1 (vector-ref D1 0)) (vector-ref D3 (random 0 5)) (vector-ref D3 (random 0 11))) ))
                  ; On this second if statement, in case the first one gives a false value, it's checking if the value from D1 is
                  ; "The Knight", and again based on the result it's going to give one value from a specific range from D3.


;; Random selection for the Enemy
(define dice4 (vector-ref D4 (random 0 5)))


;; Random selection for the Outcome
(define dice5 (vector-ref D5 (random 0 5)))

; Obs: On the functions above when using the random function when called with two integer arguments min and max, it returns a random exact integer in the range min to max-1. Therefore,
; when I used it inside the vector-ref function, which requires an index of the list, I added one more to include all of the strings.



;;; Displaying ;;;

; When you run the code it automatically generates a short story.

; I used the printf function to display everything together.

(printf "~a ~a ~a ~a ~a" dice1 dice2 dice3 dice4 dice5)
